<h3>1. http package</h3>
With Flutter:

 $ flutter pub add http
This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):

dependencies:
  http: ^1.2.1
Alternatively, your editor might support dart pub get or flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:

import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
